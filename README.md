The present study on Parmenides is a project which started in September of 2020, based on certain metrical-structural remarks on the poem, notably the fact that the phrase ἀμφὶς ἀληθείης must connect the proem of Sextus with fr.5 DK. Many people have helped me in the related study of the poem's ringcomposition. Their assistance and contribution to this project is individually noted in the main text. I would like to thank a few of them once again. Tanja Ruben and Martin Steinrueck, for discussing the details of their studies and conjectures on ringcomposition. Topher Kurfess for his nobility. Néstor Cordero for spending time with me and allowing me to convince him (about pretty much everything except the fragment I find dubious).
